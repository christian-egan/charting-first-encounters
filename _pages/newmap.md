Below are four layouts from the present rendering of my map. The culmnation of the project's different components (see [Methodology](https://christian-egan.github.io/charting-first-encounters/methodology)) can be seen in these layouts. The stark differece between the original map and this one is apparent. To summarize, least-cost paths are drawn between the twenty-three data points with consideration for the terrain, whose elevation is rendered as black to white as it ascends. Resource regions are drawn as polygons whose color ranges from pale pink to dark red, depending on the number of data points in proximity to them.

Layouts like these are effectively snapshots of the larger, dynamic project. Used here, with a compass rose and legend explaining the symbology used, layouts can present a user with a very specific presentation of one's research. Depending on what I was hoping to communicate through my map visualization, I could create layouts highlighting resource distribution or places with particularly rough terrain. In my case, I have created layouts for the entire dataset and region, as well as three that hone in on locales of particular note either for their Indigenous presence or Vancouver's interest in them.

A layout centering around Port Discovery, the site that Vancouver identified as the most promising site of settlement at this point in his voyage due to its wide range of flora and fauna and strategic location.

A layout centered on the Hood Channel, whose southern end hosted copious amounts of game animals and numerous native settlements.

![Layout10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e79c730-7190-436f-a55a-df2a6899c333)
A layout centered on Port Townshend, which Vancouver likewise envisioned as a prosperous and secure harbor. Intermittent encounters with Indigenous peoples occurred on and around its shores.
