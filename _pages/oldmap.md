This is the original map I had created during my project's infancy. In the still above, one can see the points indicating the locations of Indigenous peoples or settlements that interacted with George Vancouver during his voyage. Opened is an annotation, which provides users with the verbatim primary source text from Vancouver's writings. [A dynamic version that can be found here](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/d2d4a5c3bbce4261ab80ffc8bb491a2a). The page, hosted in ArcGIS StoryMaps, offers both a timeline view and sandbox view. The timeline places my map beside an independently-scrolling banner of text. This banner denotes the date on which each log entry was made, along with the corresponding points on the map listed below. This previews the sequence of events in Vancouver’s expedition, as well as what readers can expect from reading each point. As the user scrolls through the timeline, the map automatically moves to the next date’s cluster of points. This is, in essence, giving a viewer something of a guided tour through this portion of Vancouver's voyage. The full sandbox view can be found below.

While aesthetically sound, it lacks any use of spatial analysis tools and contributes very little to scholarship. Though there is value in this visualization (see [Pedagogy](https://christian-egan.github.io/charting-first-encounters/pedagogy)), there was simply so much more that this project could be.
